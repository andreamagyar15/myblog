                    <h3>Vitamin D: Vital Role in Your Health</h3>
                    <p>Vitamins like C and E continue to be the darlings of many supplement lovers. But those vitamin superstars are being forced to share their throne with 
                    the long neglected vitamin D, which is finally getting the attention it may have always deserved.</p>
                    <p>As the research into vitamin D is accumulating, it's hard to know where the accolades should start. "Activated vitamin D is one of the most potent
                    inhibitors of cancer cell growth," says Michael F. Holick, PhD, MD, who heads the Vitamin D, Skin, and Bone Research Laboratory at Boston University School 
                    of Medicine. "It also stimulates your pancreas to make insulin. It regulates your immune system."</p>
                    <p>No doubt, you're probably familiar with the role of vitamin D in promoting healthy bones, largely by promoting the absorption of calcium. 
                    "If you have a vitamin D deficiency, particularly in your older years, it can lead to osteoporosis or osteomalacia [bone softening]," says Lona Sandon, 
                    RD, assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas.</p>
                    <p>But there is recent and mounting evidence that links low levels of the vitamin to an increased risk of type 1 diabetes, muscle and bone pain, and, 
                    perhaps more serious, cancers of the breast, colon, prostate, ovaries, esophagus, and lymphatic system.</p>

                    <h3>Zero Calorie Foods For Weight Loss</h3>
                    <p>The theory of zero calorie foods is that the body will burn more calories metabolizing and cooking the food than the calories the food contains.
                    This is a process called thermogenesis, and it’s how your body heats itself up.</p>
                    <p>So it doesn’t mean that the food literally contains ZERO calories. It does contain some calories, but the body burns off more calories eating 
                    and digesting the food than the food itself contains.</p>
                    <p>So make sure you add more of these foods to your diet any chance you get!  They will keep you away from calories and still fill you up.</p>

                    <h3>How much sleep is enough?</h3>
                    <p> Five to 7 hours. But if you continuously sleep for less than four or more than 10 hours, you should see a doctor to rule out a pathological 
                    condition. Some people claim that we – as a society – are not sleeping enough due to all the modern temptations like TV and the Internet, but in 
                    my view our modern life is just too interesting to sleep longer. And before we compare ourselves to our ancestors and their “healthier” sleeping habits,
                    we should remember that they had to climb up trees and cling to branches in order to avoid the worst – but not all – of the imminent dangers. Generally,
                    I believe that it all depends on preferences,
                    demands and satisfaction. If someone is satisfied with his or her personal sleeping pattern – however unconventional – it’s fine.</p>
                    <p> Important functions like healing and memory decrease, because sleep is necessary to maintain our cognitive functions and control inflammatory processes.
                    But generally we tend to get the sleep that is urgently needed – even if it means dozing off at inconvenient times. Microsleep
                    – brief periods of dozing off – can probably keep us going over a couple of days, even if it’s with slow heads and a terrible mood..</p>

                    <h3>Mentally Strong People: The 5 Things They Avoids</h3>
                    <p> 1.Waste Time Feeling Sorry for Themselves</p>
                    <p>You don’t see mentally strong people feeling sorry for their circumstances or dwelling on the way they’ve been mistreated. They have learned to take responsibility
                    for their actions and outcomes, and they have an inherent understanding of the fact that frequently life is not fair. They are able to emerge from trying circumstances 
                    with self-awareness and gratitude for the lessons learned. When a situation turns out badly, they respond with phrases such as “Oh, well.” Or perhaps simply, “Next!”</p>
                    <p>2. Give Up After Failure.</p>
                    <p> Every failure is a chance to improve. Even the greatest entrepreneurs are willing to admit that their early efforts invariably brought many failures. Mentally 
                    strong people are willing to fail again and again, if necessary, as long as the learning experience from every “failure” can bring them closer to their ultimate goals.</p>
                    <p>3. Expect Immediate Results.</p>
                    <p>Whether it’s a workout plan, a nutritional regimen, or starting a business, mentally strong people are “in it for the long haul”. They know better than to expect
                    immediate results. They apply their energy and time in measured doses and they celebrate each milestone and increment of success on the way. They have “staying power.”
                    And they understand that genuine changes take time. Do you have mental strength?
                    Are there elements on this list you need more of? With thanks to Amy Morin, I would like to reinforce my own abilities further in each of these areas today. How about you?</p>
                    <p>4. Waste Energy on Things They Can’t Control. </p>
                    <p> Mentally strong people don’t complain (much) about bad traffic, lost luggage, or especially about other people, as they recognize that all of these factors are generally 
                    beyond their control. In a bad situation, they recognize that the one thing they can always control is their own response and attitude, and they use these attributes well.</p>                    
                    <p>5. Fear Alone Time.  </p>
                    <p> Mentally strong people enjoy and even treasure the time they spend alone. They use their downtime to reflect, to plan, and to be productive. Most importantly, they don’t
                    depend on others to shore up their happiness and moods. They can be happy with others, and they can also be happy alone.</p>
